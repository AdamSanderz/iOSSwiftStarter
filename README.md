# iOSSwiftStarter
A sample iOS app written in Swift using the VIPER architecture.

***

By writing this paper, my goal is to describe how I came up with the iOS app architecture I suggest.
It's a step by step writing to follow the reasons bringing me to set up the different components I chose.

The aim of the template application is very simple: it's a master/detail application to present a list of GitHub repositories of a given user.
Although it's simple, it gathers some classical jobs when writing an application:

* consume a REST API
* save data to a local storage
* load data from this local storage
* architecture the logical layer and navigation between screens

Let's discover what's hiding under the hood!

### [[Dependency management]]

### [[Consuming REST API]]

### [[Managing jobs]]

### [[Communication between components with passing data]]

### [[Data persistence]]

### [[Make thinner view controllers]]

### [[The VIPER architecture]]

### [[Unit testing]]

### Conclusion

All these tools/libraries combined together lead us to a clear, clean, reliable and testable project template where we can add and maintain features (i.e. modules) easily, in a very intelligible way. 
What we've got is a robust arsenal of components that are interchangeable if needed.
